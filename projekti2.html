        <h1 class="title">Helsinki Design Week</h1>
        <p class="inf">
            I created a practice poster for the 2022 Helsinki Design Week, which focused on architecture. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the fundamentals and implementation techniques of graphic design. Here are the key learning experiences I'd like to share:

        </div>
        <div class="hel">
        <h3>Significance of Typography</h3>'
        <p class="text">
            The poster's title was a central element of its attractiveness. I carefully selected a font that was in line with the style and ensured that the title stood out effectively. Through the appropriate use of typography, I strengthened the visual identity and message of the poster.
        </p>
        <h3>Clear Communication</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Communicating essential information, such as the event's date and location, was of paramount importance. I structured the text clearly and balanced it to make sure crucial details were easily noticeable.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Proficiency</h3>
        <p class="text">
            The technical execution of graphic design was a critical part of the project. Skill and precision were required to apply perforations and cutouts correctly. The poster's clean appearance was crucial to its success.   
        </p>
        <h3>Visual Appeal</h3>
        <p class="text">
            I recognized the importance of making the poster visually appealing. A striking appearance attracts people's interest in the event and encourages them to participate.
        </p>
        <h3>Emphasis on Theme</h3>
        <p class="text">
            I understood the necessity of emphasizing the event's theme visually. This was especially crucial when the theme was 'We Are Open' with a focus on architecture. I carefully selected an image that reflected the festival's theme and created a strong connection between architecture and openness.
        </p>

This project helped me refine my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of graphic design.

        <h3>Grocery store advertisement</h3>
        <p class="inf">I designed and created an advertisement using Adobe Illustrator. In this task, I strictly adhered to the provided template, including fonts, colors, and layout dimensions. The advertisement featured the store's logo, contact information, a headline, tilted text, a footer text, and the main image for the offer.<br><br></p>
        
        <p class="inf">Furthermore, I selected and illustrated six different offers with product images, each including price and quantity details. I aimed to maintain the visual consistency of the advertisement with the provided template and ensured that the text and images were prominently displayed.<br><br></p>

            <h3>Långholmen Archipelago Hotel campaign</h3>
            <p class="inf">I created a practice magazine advertisement for Långholmen Archipelago Hotel, aligning it with the 'LONG HOT SUMMER' campaign's ambiance and the hotel's brand. Throughout this exercise, I learned several key lessons.<br><br></p>
            <p class="inf">In terms of image selection, I thoughtfully chose images that conveyed the summer archipelago atmosphere and showcased the hotel's offerings. I paid particular attention to selecting a fitting image to replace the 'O', ensuring it was visually appealing, informative, and still easily readable.<br><br></p>
            
           
         <p class="inf">The color palette I selected harmonized with the campaign's visual identity, emphasizing the archipelago and the experience of boating.<br><br></p>
    
         <p class="inf">For font choices, I opted for fonts that were consistent with the hotel's brand and highly legible. The body text font lent the advertisement a professional appearance and contributed to the clarity of the text.<br><br></p>

         <p class="inf">When it came to text content, I made decisions regarding the amount of text to include in the advertisement, ensuring that it conveyed essential information about the hotel's services and contact details. I aimed to make the text both informative and engaging.<br><br></p>

         <p class="inf">The layout and design were also pivotal. I maintained a visual balance between the image and text, guaranteeing that the advertisement looked appealing while delivering the desired information.<br><br></p>
