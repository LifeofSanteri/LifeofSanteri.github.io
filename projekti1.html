        <h3>What is this about?</h3>
        <p class="text">
            In this project, we focused on WhatsApp group chats, particularly on the 
            management of old and inactive groups. Our goal was to gather user experiences
             and identify potential issues they encounter when it comes to preserving and
              managing groups within the application. Our aim was to identify how we could
               improve the manageability of groups and determine whether inactive groups 
               are perceived as problematic.</p>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>
            <p class="text">
                A total of 68 individuals participated in the survey. The survey was designed flexibly, with 
                its length and questions varying based on respondents' preferences and experiences. The survey 
                provided comprehensive insights into how users perceive inactive groups and their management.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="user-container">
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p class="text">
                We conducted interviews with 7 users to delve into their experiences and perspectives. 
                The interviews were carried out using a semi-structured interview framework, allowing for 
                flexible discussions. Transcriptions of the interviews were compiled. Our focus was to 
                gain a deeper understanding of users' needs and desires.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="user-container">
        <h3>Affinity Analysis</h3>
            <p class="text">
                We utilized affinity analysis to organize and categorize the data collected within our
                team. This analysis helped us identify common themes and pain points, which guided the
                refinement of our research and solutions.</p>
        </div>
         
        <div class="user-container">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Based on the interviews, we constructed four distinct user personas. 
                These personas aimed to provide insights into the diverse needs and expectations of 
                different users, including both younger and older individuals, and their ways of 
                communicating with family and friends.</p>

        <div class="user-container">
        <h3>User Journeys</h3>
            <p class="text">
                We described user journeys and touchpoints using Service Blueprints, which aided our understanding 
                of how users interact with the WhatsApp application in various scenarios. These user journeys were 
                instrumental in enhancing the user experience, particularly in managing inactive groups. <br></p>

        <div class="problem">
        <p class="text">
            Users find inactive groups less problematic than group management challenges. The study reveals that <b>52.9% did not consider</b> inactive groups harmful, while 47.1% found them somewhat disturbing. Some users view inactive groups as a drawback but may not actively seek an easier removal solution. </p> <br><br>
 
            <img src="kuvat/52.png" alt="1" class="image" width="250px">
        
        <p class="text">
            Users find group management and navigation challenging. Research results suggest that <b>they desire better group management</b>. While most respondents actively use groups, they struggle with sorting and managing them, negatively impacting the user experience within the app.</p> <br><br>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Users distinguish between apps offering diverse group management options. The study reveals that many <b>utilize different group messaging apps</b> and may <b class="not">not wish to transfer these features</b> to WhatsApp, indicating a preference for using various apps for distinct group needs.<br><br>

            These user issues are crucial starting points for enhancing the WhatsApp group management experience. Users seek <b>more efficient group navigation</b> and improved management solutions. The planned enhancements and features are designed to meet these user needs and desires.</p>

            effortlessly make use of them.<br><br>
            <img src="kuvat/iphone7.png" alt="1" class="ip7" >

            

            <b class="not">In the implementation phase,</b> we transitioned from theory to practice by creating prototypes of our proposed solutions. We employed the Figma program for prototyping and design, developing a total of four <img src="kuvat/iphone8.png" alt="1" class="ip8" width="250px"> distinct prototypes, each with its unique workflow. These prototypes aimed to showcase how users could seamlessly navigate between different views and utilize new features.<br><br>

 
            <b>We employed Figma to craft interactive prototypes,</b> demonstrating the practical functionality of the new features. Each prototype prioritized a seamless and intuitive user experience to ensure easy adoption of our solutions. Figma also streamlined teamwork collaboration, a crucial element for project success.</p>

            This objective was achieved during the design phase, where we 
            created four different prototypes with proposed solutions. 
            These prototypes provided practical examples of how group management 
            could be improved, with a particular focus on separating groups from
